# Analysis of Malaria (2000 - 2017)
Malaria is an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
In this project we attempt to use the data to generate usefull summaries and meaningful visualization
that answer the following questions:
1. What is the year-on-year trend of malaria cases, deaths and death rates
2. Which regions have the highest number of cases, deaths and death rates combined
3. Which countries in Africa have the highest cases combined
4. Which countries in Western Pacific have the highest death rates in the whole period.

In addition, a linear model for the number of deaths given the number of cases globally, is created
